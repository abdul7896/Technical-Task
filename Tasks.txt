GCP Cloud Storage offers two systems for granting users permission to access buckets and objects: Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) and Access Control Lists (ACLs). These systems act in parallel—in order for a user to access a Cloud Storage resource, only one of the systems must grant the user permission. GCP Cloud IAM allows us to grant a variety of permissions at the bucket and project levels. ACLs are used only by Cloud Storage and have limited permission options, but they allow us to grant permissions on a per-object basis. Ensure that cloud storage buckets have uniform bucket-level access enabled.

Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) and security key enforcement for all admin accounts. Service accounts also play a vital role in today’s infrastructure. Only GCP-managed service accounts keys should be associated with service accounts, and service accounts should not have admin privileges. Enforcing separation of duties while assigning service accounts related roles to users also protects against PII data breach. Also, ensure a key rotation policy of 90 days or less for both KMS encryption keys and API keys.
